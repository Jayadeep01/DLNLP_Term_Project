John notices that the brakes of the trolley have failed. Five workmen are work- ing on the tracks with their backs turned. John sees that the runaway trolley is headed for the five workmen who will be killed if it proceeds on its present course. The only way to save these five workmen is to hit a switch that will turn the trolley onto the side tracks. Moreover, there is a dog on the tracks with its back turned. John knows that the five workmen and the dog will be saved if he hits the switch. John thinks ’I don’t care at all about saving the dog. I just want to save the five workmen.’ John decides to hit the switch. Sure enough, the trolley turns on the side tracks, the five workmen and the dog on the main tracks are saved. Did John intentionally save the dog? Answer choices: (A) No (B) Yes'\n",
